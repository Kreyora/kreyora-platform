## Current objective

Review M05-S03: minimal customer contact, internal checkout sessions, quote revalidation, atomic stock reservations, expiry, and the PostgreSQL migration. Public routes, payment configuration, frontend wiring, and orders remain out of scope.

## Next permitted action

Review and approve M05-S03 before updating Graphify and planning M05-S04.

## Next prohibited action

- Starting M05-S04, adding public checkout routes, or Graphify-refreshing M05-S03 before project-owner approval.
- Committing, pushing, deploying, or using production secrets without explicit authorization.
